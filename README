Bricklayer Manual

* Requirements
Bricklayer uses twisted to serve a restful interface as well as the scheduler interface, it also needs sqlalchemy to save projects in a sqlite database (works with any other database supported by sqlalchemy) but sqlalchemy is included in the project so to install bricklayer dependencies on a debian systems just shot the following in your shell:
    $ apt-get install python-twisted

* Installation
Bricklayer has a debian directory ready to be built, to do so under a debian-based system run:
    $ apt-get install build-scripts
    $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot # (inside the project directory)
    $ dpkg -i ../bricklayer*.deb # were * is your architecture and version

* Usage
Bricklayer has a restful interface that accepts the following parameters:
    POST /project -> params:
        name="bricklayer" # The project name
        version="1.0-1"   # Initial version (will be incremented by each git commit or hudson git tag)
        git_url="git://host/project/repository.git" # Repository URL to watch
        build_cmd="make"  # Command within your project that generate binaries or prepare your project to be installed 
        install_cmd="make install PREFIX=debian/tmp" # A command within your project that install the generated binaries

    GET /project/name:
        Return the attributes of the project in JSON format

* Building ruby applications ?

Bricklayer uses RVM to handle multimo ruby projects to be built in the same machine, to use rvm you must provide a .rvmrc or .rvmrc.example (if you don't want a .rvmrc hanging on your project repository) using the rvmrc syntax as usual. It is highly recommended that you use this if you are building multiples projects using different ruby versions.
